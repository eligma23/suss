# suss

**Find bugs with a codebase-aware AI agent.**

Suss looks for bugs in your local code changes. Just run `suss` in your terminal to get a bug report in under a minute.

This works by analyzing the diff between your local and remote branch. For each code change, an agent explores your codebase to gather context on the change (e.g. dependencies, code paths, etc.). Then a reasoning model uses that context to evaluate the change and identify potential bugs.

You'll be surprised with how many bugs this can catch â€” even complex, multi-file bugs. Think of `suss` as a quick and dirty code review before pushing your code. 

## Installation

```bash
> pipx install suss
```

Once installed, you must choose an LLM provider. To use OpenAI or Anthropic, just add your API key to your environment:

```bash
> export OPENAI_API_KEY="..." # For GPT
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..." # For Claude
```

You can also use other models, including local ones. `suss` wraps LiteLLM, so you can use any model listed [here.](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)

**Optional:** You can boost performance using the [Cohere reranker model.](https://cohere.com/rerank) Just add your Cohere API key to your environment:

```bash
> export COHERE_API_KEY="..."
```

## Usage

Run `suss` in the root directory of your codebase.

By default, it analyzes every [code file](https://github.com/shobrook/suss/blob/master/suss/constants/languages.py) that's new or modified compared to your remote branch. These are the same files you see when you run `git status`.

To run `suss` on a specific file:

```bash
> suss --file="path/to/file.py"
```
